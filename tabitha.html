        <h1>Invention of Circular Saw</h1>
        <p> Tabitha Babbitt was a weaver who was born into the Shaker community, which thrived off of the forest industry. One day she was watching two men using a pit saw (saw you pull back and forth) to cut down a tree. She noticed the saw wouldn't cut on the reverse pull, which meant they're doing double the work. She wanted to come up with a way to save all that wasted energy lost by using a pit saw. So, she came up with a prototype, later called the circular saw. She attached a circular blade to her spinning wheel, and using the pedal attached to the wheel to spin it, no energy was now wasted.
